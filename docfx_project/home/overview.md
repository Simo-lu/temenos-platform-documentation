### What is Temenos PaaS?

Temenos PaaS is a type of cloud service offered by Temenos Cloud; it is a *Platform as a Service (PaaS)* that provides individuals and teams with the ability to manage and configure their own instances of Temenos applications and approved 3rd party Plug & Play applications from the Temenos ecosystem.

### What is DevX?

“DevX” is a cloud based infrastructure for use during development, test, implementation, and ongoing change with configurable and scalable Temenos Suites on-demand. DevX enables you to create Environments, i.e. Temenos Suites on-demand, for non-production use in the cloud.  Environments can be requested and provisioned within minutes rather than weeks helping you accelerate your projects. Retail Suite is readily available, with all other Temenos Suites (Corporate, Wealth, Micro-Finance and Islamic Banking) available on request and allow you to develop and test your proof of concept, share development environments across dispersed teams, replicate production environments or use them for training. The speed, reliability, and agility of these environments will instantly add value to your implementation and scale your project delivery capacity.

The Development platform has the capability to provision environments in a variety of different configurations. Users can initiate a new environment and select from a predefined list of templates the application, the release and stack they wish to provision. Each month we host a new template with the latest release of Temenos suite. 

The environments are customisable in terms of Name and brief description to explain their purpose. The templates follow the official Temenos configuration stack but it can be customised for Releases 2016 onwards.

## **Data and Security Considerations**

----------

The most important consideration with respect to data on the Temenos PaaS platform is that it for **non-production use only**.  For clarification, no 'personally identifiable information'; 'confidential' or 'sensitive' data may be stored on any sandbox environments.

Other considerations include:

•   Data is stored in UK datacentres

•   Data is encrypted in transit

•   Access to sandbox management facilities requires username/password and/or SSH certificates

•   Environments can be deleted immediately by the user. All client-related data will be deleted by Temenos 60 days 
after the termination of the agreement
