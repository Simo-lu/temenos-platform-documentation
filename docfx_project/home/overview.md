# **Temenos Cloud Development Platform**

## **DevX** 


----------

### What is Temenos PaaS?

Temenos PaaS is a type of cloud service offered by Temenos Cloud; it is a *Platform as a Service (PaaS)* that provides individuals and teams with the ability to manage and configure their own instances of Temenos applications and approved 3rd party Plug & Play applications from the Temenos ecosystem.

### What is DevX?

“DevX” is a cloud based infrastructure for use during development, test, implementation, and ongoing change with configurable and scalable Temenos Suites on-demand. DevX enables you to create Environments, i.e. Temenos Suites on-demand, for non-production use in the cloud.  Environments can be requested and provisioned within minutes rather than weeks helping you accelerate your projects. Retail Suite is readily available, with all other Temenos Suites (Corporate, Wealth, Micro-Finance and Islamic Banking) available on request and allow you to develop and test your proof of concept, share development environments across dispersed teams, replicate production environments or use them for training. The speed, reliability, and agility of these environments will instantly add value to your implementation and scale your project delivery capacity.

## **Implementation FAQs**

----------

- **How can a customer gain access to DevX?**

The client should go through the normal procurement process for a Temenos Cloud service.  Temenos regional sales. 

- **What are the minimum system requirements?**

Internet access over https.

- **How can a customer deploy DevX?**

The clients will be supplied with a URL and initial login, from there they will be able to create their own environments at their chosen release, add users for a developer or team of developers and then they can create the environments immediately. The users can create up to the maximum number of environments purchased, once the environment is destroyed, another individual or team can create a new environment up to the maximum. This means that many teams can share a single subscription, very useful to remove barriers within project and in fully automated testing.

- **Who will handle customers’ queries/issues for DevX?**

Sales queries will be handled via the Temenos Cloud (TemenosCloud@temenos.com) support team. Support is available through a dedicated online support portal for cloud infrastructure issues.  All Product issues remain through the Temenos Customer Support. 


## **Data and Security Considerations**

The most important consideration with respect to data on the Temenos PaaS platform is that it for non-production use only.  For clarification, no 'personally identifiable information'; 'confidential' or 'sensitive' data may be stored on any sandbox environments.

Other considerations include:

•   Data is stored in UK datacentres

•   Data is encrypted in transit

•   Access to sandbox management facilities requires username/password and/or SSH certificates

•   Environments can be deleted immediately by the user. All client-related data will be deleted by Temenos 60 days 
after the termination of the agreement
