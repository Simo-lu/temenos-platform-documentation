## **DevX**

### What is Temenos DevX Platform?

“DevX” is a cloud based infrastructure for use during development, test, implementation, and ongoing change with configurable and scalable Temenos Suites on-demand. DevX enables you to create Environments, i.e. Temenos Suites on-demand, for non-production use in the cloud.  Environments can be requested and provisioned within minutes rather than weeks helping you accelerate your projects. Retail Suite is readily available, with all other Temenos Suites (Corporate, Wealth, Micro-Finance and Islamic Banking) available on request and allow you to develop and test your proof of concept, share development environments across dispersed teams, replicate production environments or use them for training. The speed, reliability, and agility of these environments will instantly add value to your implementation and scale your project delivery capacity.

## **Data and Security Considerations**

----------

The most important consideration with respect to data on the Temenos PaaS platform is that it for **non-production use only**.  For clarification, no 'personally identifiable information'; 'confidential' or 'sensitive' data may be stored on any sandbox environments.

Other considerations include:

•   Data is stored in UK datacentres

•   Data is encrypted in transit

•   Access to sandbox management facilities requires username/password and/or SSH certificates

•   Environments can be deleted immediately by the user. All client-related data will be deleted by Temenos 60 days 
after the termination of the agreement
