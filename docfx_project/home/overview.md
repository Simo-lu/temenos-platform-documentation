## How Temenos Cloud Templates Work 


The Temenos PaaS platform has the capability to provision environments in a variety of different configurations.  This capability is driven through the concept of 'Templates' - a simplified view of the constituent elements which make up a sandbox configuration, including:

- Server Size
- Basic server setup and technology stack
- T24 version to deploy

By default, new templates are added with each monthly release of T24. These templates follow a standard pattern, configuration and technology stack, but with the most recent releases of T24 being deployed.

However, the Temenos PaaS platform team also offer the ability to create customised templates for clients.  For more information, please contact temenoscloud@temenos.com.
