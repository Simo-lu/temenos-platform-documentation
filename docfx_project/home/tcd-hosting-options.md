## **Temenos Continuous Deployment Hosting Option**
The Temenos Continuous Deployment platform has two distinct deployment domains as below:

 - 
 the “Platform Cloud” where the provisioning software runs;
 - 
 the “Target Cloud” where the T24 environments are provisioned.

<br>There are a number of options:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;1. All hosted on Temenos SaaS - this is Azure;
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;2. The Platform component is hosted on Temenos SaaS. The Target Cloud is a bank’s public cloud - the hybrid model (target cloud is an Azure subscription owned by the bank);  <br />
&nbsp; &nbsp;3. All hosted on the bank’s cloud - all hosted on the bank’s AWS account.  <br />

<br>
The advantages of the various offerings:
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;**a) Temenos hosted**  - this is a full-service SaaS offering with Support desk, monitoring, SLAs. The bank benefits from the regular rollout of new features. There are no technical pre-requisites to use the service. A service/hosting agreement is required with Temenos SaaS.  
<br>&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;**b) The bank runs it all on their public cloud (AWS or Azure)** - there is no service element to this; the bank has full responsibility for installing and operating the platform. 
<brbr><br><br>


**There are two primary service models depending on whether the client is using Temenos SaaS for both the service, and the Target Cloud; or using their own cloud environment for the Target Cloud.**
