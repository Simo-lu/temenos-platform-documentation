# Stream API/UI – Feature Description #

A Stream is a collective name representing all coordinated efforts by an organization (that are registered to use the assemble module) to make a specific improvement to their deployed product. 

For example a bank that is running T24 can choose to make a new enhancement to the T24 installation. All efforts to develop, test and release this enhancement can be collectively called a stream.

It represents a group dedicated to a specific development feature (or other logical grouping to represent a new feature implementation etc) that may consist of the following resources:

1.	People – Developers, testers, business managers and other people involved in developing new features for the bank.

2.	Code and other digital resources – Code specific to the features, Binaries, VMs, Test Scripts etc

3.	Processes – Each team works with a different workflow and may have variations in the processes.

Each stream requires an isolated setup of resources to keep their work separate from other streams. For example, each stream will have a separate folder (or repository) for all of their digital resources and can possibly implement a customized workflow for their development promotion. Each stream has other inherent components for it to be useful. 
The parts of the stream are listed below:

1.	Stages (Discussed in the Stages API)

2.	Components (Discussed in the Components API)

3.	Products (Discussed in the Products API)

4.	Factories (Discussed in the Factories API)

5.	Factory Run (Discussed in the Factory Run API)

6.	Environments (Discussed in the Environments API)

 These components, together, act as an isolated group of elements for each Stream and help an organization create a manage efforts of a group. An organization can create as many streams as needed. Each stream is just a logical name for the grouping and has nothing more than a “Name” and a “Description”.
