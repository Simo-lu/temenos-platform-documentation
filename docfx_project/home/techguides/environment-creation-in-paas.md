- **Environments**

The Development platform has the capability to provision environments in a variety of different configurations. Users can initiate a new environment and select from a predefined list of templates the application, the release and stack they wish to provision. Each month we host a new template with the latest release of Temenos suite. 

The environments are customisable in terms of Name and brief description to explain their purpose. The templates follow the official Temenos configuration stack but it can be customised for Releases 2016 onwards.
